      <h2>Nmap is a scanning tool used to identify weaknesses in a network and learn more about the devies on it...</h2>
      <p>It works with both <span class="term">TCP & UDP</span> to scan a network but will stick to only TCP as it's more reliable and faster. It only uses UDP when you tell it to which will be shown in an example below.</p>
      <h2>Examples:</h2>
      <div class="code">
        # Here we do a simple scan of a network from IP 172.10.10.1 to 172.10.10.100...

        nmap -sn 172.10.10.1 172.10.10.100
            -sn is used for simple ping scans, where no ports are scanned
            -n is used to prevent reverse lookup, which makes the scan a lot faster
      </div>

      <div class="code">
        # To detect OS use the OS fingerprinting option ( -O )...

        nmap -n -O 172.10.10.10
      </div>
      <p class="warning">This is not always correct sometimes NMAP guesses, keep this in mind and use common sence!</p>

      <div class="code">
        # Scanning all ports on a machine can be interesting if services are running on non-standard ports!
        # (It's best you do this on a single machine, as otherwise your scan will be slow!)

        nmap -n -p- 172.10.10.10

        # If the service would be unknown you can use banner grabbing to find out...

        nmap -n -p25252 172.10.10.10 -sV       # This scans 172.10.10.10:2525 and tries to find out what service is running on it...
